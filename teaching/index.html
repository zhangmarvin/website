    <h2>teaching</h2>
    <p>
    I was an undergraduate student instructor (UGSI, or TA) for
    <a class="link" href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s16/">CS 189/289A</a>,
    the machine learning course at Berkeley, for the Spring 2016 semester. In
    the Fall 2015 semester, I was a UGSI for
    <a class="link" href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/">CS 188</a>,
    the introductory artificial intelligence course. Before that, I was a UGSI
    for <a class="link" href="http://cs61a.org">CS 61A</a>, the introductory
    computer science course, for three semesters. All of these courses are
    extremely popular, and have seen enrollment grow exponentially in recent
    years. Teaching was a major facet of my time as an undergraduate, and my
    instructor ratings can be found
    <a class="link" href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/instructor/7857">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    During my time teaching CS 61A, I was involved in several parts of the
    course beyond just TAing. Most notably, I developed a new project for the
    course, and I was the lead instructor with
    <a class="link" href="http://brianhou.com/">Brian Hou</a> for the Summer
    2016 semester, where I had the opportunity to give lectures for over 400
    students and mentor a new generation of TAs. All resources from the Summer
    2016 semester, including lecture slides and assignments, can be found from
    the
    <a class="link" href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su16/">course website</a>.

                    This is a project that I developed along with fellow UGSI
                    <a class="link" href="http://brianhou.com/">Brian Hou</a>
                    and Professor
                    <a class="link" href="http://www.denero.org/">John DeNero</a>.
                    In this project, students construct a visualization of
                    restaurant ratings for restaurants in the Berkeley area
                    utilizing the
                    <a class="link" href="https://www.yelp.com/academic_dataset">Yelp Academic Dataset</a>, 
                    using both existing user ratings as well as predicting
                    ratings by analyzing user preferences. This project teaches
                    concepts such as data abstraction, lists, and dictionaries,
                    and also serves as an introduction into the field of machine
                    learning. This project was featured as a part of
                    <a class="link" href="http://nifty.stanford.edu/">SIGCSE Nifty Assignments</a>.
