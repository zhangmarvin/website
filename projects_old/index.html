    Here are some of the projects I've worked on in my free time.

                <h4>North American Happiness</h4>
                <p>
                This is a project that I built in collaboration with my
                roommates,
                <a class="link" href="http://shreyaschand.com/">Shreyas Chand</a>
                and
                <a class="link" href="http://brianhou.com/">Brian Hou</a>, for
                our
                <a class="link" href="https://sites.google.com/a/bodik.org/cs164/home">CS 164</a>
                final project. This library allows multiple users on different
                machines to collaboratively make music together through a
                network connection. It was designed with programmers in mind,
                and very little musical knowledge is necessary to successfully
                compose complex and interesting musical pieces with other users.
                Fun fact: North American Happiness is also the name of the
                electronic rock band that we hope to start one day.

                <p>
                This is the new website for the UC Berkeley Nu chapter of
                <a class="link" href="http://upe.acm.org/">Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>,
                the national Computer Science honor society. As one of the
                former IT and web development chairs, I led a committee in
                designing and building the backend of this website using
                <a class="link" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
                The code for this project can be found on
                <a class="link" href="https://github.com/upenu/website">Github</a>.

                <p>
                This is a web app written in HTML&nbsp;/&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;/&nbsp;JS
                that allows the user to watch an endless stream of YouTube
                videos picked from an initial starting video. Users have the
                option to skip videos, pick how related they'd like the next
                video to be, and rewatch previous videos. I built this in
                collaboration with
                <a class="link" href="http://shreyaschand.com/">Shreyas Chand</a>
                and
                <a class="link" href="http://brianhou.com/">Brian Hou</a>, and
                the code for this project can be found on
                <a class="link" href="https://github.com/brianhou/YouTubeRadio">Github</a>.
                Note that, due to an API issue, the site currently does not work.

                <p>
                This is a small program that I initially wrote for
                <a class="link" href="http://cs61a.org">CS 61A</a> to assign TAs
                to sections based on their availability and preferences. I later
                adapted the code for use by
                <a class="link" href="http://tmc.berkeley.edu/">The Music Connection</a>,
                to assign tutors to sites across the
                <a class="link" href="http://www.berkeleyschools.net/">Berkeley Unified School District</a>.
                The program uses
                <a class="link" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/">lp_solve</a>,
                a mixed-integer linear programming solver, to discover optimal
                assignments, and was designed such that a non-programmer could
                be easily taught how to use it.
