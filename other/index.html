    The best way to get in touch with me is to
    <a class="link" href="mailto:zhangmarvin@berkeley.edu">send me an email</a>
    at [zhangmarvin&nbsp;at&nbsp;berkeley&nbsp;dot&nbsp;edu]. Things I like
    talking about include, but are not limited to: Washington, D.C., area sports
    teams (I'm originally from Bethesda, MD), shows I have watched or am
    currently watching (Mad Men, Game of Thrones, and Bojack Horseman, to name a
    few), and John Mayer.

    For other ways to contact me, and also if you would like to find more
    professional-type information, check out my:
    <a class="link" href="/misc/cv.pdf">CV</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marvinzhang">LinkedIn</a>.
    My CV is, generally speaking, more academically oriented and usually more
    up-to-date.

    As mentioned elsewhere, I'm heavily involved with 
    <a class="link" href="http://tmc.berkeley.edu/">The Music Connection</a>,
    a UC Berkeley club that provides free supplementary music tutoring to
    children in the
    <a class="link" href="http://www.berkeleyschools.net/">Berkeley Unified School District</a>.
    I have served as both the Publicity Chair and the President for this club,
    and am still an active member and tutor. Tutors help run various programs in
    the Berkeley community, including in-class, after-school, and private
    tutoring. For more information and details on how to get involved, visit
    their website at
    <a class="link" href="http://tmc.berkeley.edu/">tmc.berkeley.edu</a>.

    Also mentioned elsewhere, I sometimes play violin in the 
    <a class="link" href="http://orchestra.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra</a>.
